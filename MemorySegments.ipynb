    "- memory a program uses is typically divided into 2 main spaces:\n",
    "    1. kernel space - reserved for running the kernel (OS background processes, device drivers, etc.)\n",
    "    2. user space - user-mode applications are loaded\n",

    "- in C/C++ programs, user space is dividied into 5 different areas, called segments:\n",

    "    1. Stack segment, also called scratch pad\n",
    "        - function parameters, local variables, and other function-related register varialbes are stored\n",
    "        - grows and shrinks based on program needs\n",
    "    2. Heap segment\n",
    "        - dynamically allocated variables (using pointers) are allocated from this segment\n",
    "        - Heap size is normally much larger compared to stack size\n",
    "        - size (acutal) grows and shrinks based on program needs\n",
    "    3. BSS segment (Block Started by Symbol, also called the uninitialized data segment)\n",
    "        - zero-initialized or uninitialized global and static variables are stored\n",
    "    4. Data segment (also called the initialized data segment)\n",
    "        - initialized global and static variables are stored\n",
    "    5. Text segment (also called a code segment)\n",
    "        - compiled program/code is loaded\n",
    "        - code segment is typically read-only.\n",
